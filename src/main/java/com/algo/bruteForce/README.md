# Brute Force

**Brute force** algorithms are straightforward methods that try all possible solutions to a problem until the correct one is found. They are often inefficient but easy to implement and understand.

## âœ… Key Characteristics of Brute Force Algorithms:

* Simple to understand and implement
* Often inefficient (slow for large inputs)
* Guarantees finding a solution if one exists

## ðŸ§° When to Use Brute Force

1. Small Input Size
* If the dataset is small (like 10â€“100 elements), brute force can be faster and easier than complex algorithms.
* Example: Linear search in a small array.
2. Simple Implementation Needed
* When you need a quick and easy solution without worrying about performance.
* Great for prototypes or proof of concept.
3. No Known Efficient Algorithm
* Some problems (like NP-complete problems) donâ€™t have efficient solutions, so brute force may be your only option.
* Example: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Subset Sum.
4. Guaranteed Correctness
* Brute force checks all possible solutions, so it guarantees finding the correct answer (if there is one).
* Useful in testing or validating more complex algorithms.
5. Educational Purposes
* Brute force is excellent for learning problem-solving and understanding algorithm basics.
6. Early Stopping Possible
* If you can stop early (e.g., find the first valid solution), brute force becomes more practical.
* Example: Password cracking with a known pattern.
